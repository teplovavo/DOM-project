316 Project

This is Card Game in Candy-Styling, so it could match to my previous project - Candy Shop. I want to combine it all in one project.
I love this game it's very popular and i think you can train your memory as well.
I enjoyed working on that project.

How it works:

First of all you need to put your name in input, there is validation added, the length must be at least 3 symbols.
Then you have to click on cards and find matching cards.
When the cards matches, they became green.
There is a button to have a hint, so if you click it, two matching card will return for a second.
After all cards became green the congratulations pops up, with a GIF of candies.
